Description: An R package to enable the creation of high quality hexagonally binned graphs
that can exploit all of ggplot2 functionality. A hexagonal grid is overlaid over the data, and
the data points are to the closest hexagonal bin. Each bin is sized in proportion to the number of points
that it contains, allowing tens, hundreds, or even thousands of points to be represented by a single bin, and
allowing the observer to get an intuitive feel for the density of data points, while simultaneously allowing for
additional visualizations (regression lines, groupings, text, etc.) to be seen clearly.

Depends: data.table, ggplot2
